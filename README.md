Overview

FinSense is a modern, full-stack application designed to help users quickly gauge market sentiment by aggregating financial headlines and applying real-time, simulated Natural Language Processing (NLP) to them.

This project showcases expertise in Full-Stack Development (React/Next.js), Data Visualization (Recharts), Cloud Persistence (Firebase Firestore), and Predictive Analytics/NLP. It provides a clean, responsive dashboard for tracking market mood and saving articles for later review.

🚀 Project Demo (Animation Placeholder)

Showcase the app in action! This GIF should demonstrate the key features: the sentiment chart updating, filtering headlines by sentiment, and saving/unsaving an article.

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create a short (10-15 second) GIF of the application running.
2. Upload the GIF to your GitHub repository (e.g., in an 'assets' folder).
3. Replace the placeholder text below with your GIF URL.

Key Features

The application is built around data processing, visualization, and user experience:

Simulated NLP Sentiment Analysis: Each incoming headline is instantly analyzed and assigned a sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) and a corresponding score (0.0 to 1.0).

Interactive Sentiment Trend Chart: A line chart visualizes the Average Daily Market Sentiment Score, allowing users to quickly identify shifts in overall market mood over time.

Sentiment and Keyword Filtering: Users can filter the headline list to view only Positive, Negative, or Neutral articles, and use a dedicated search bar to find articles by specific keywords or stock tickers.

Persistent Article Saving: Users can save important articles to their profile. This functionality is backed by Firebase Firestore, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

Modern and Responsive UI: Built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a fast, mobile-friendly, and professional user interface.

Application Architecture (Simulated)

The application component (FinancialNewsAggregator.jsx) is designed to integrate into a modern JavaScript stack (like Next.js or a standalone React app).

Frontend (FinSense Dashboard): Handles all rendering, user interaction, filtering, and data visualization.

Data Simulation Layer: The runSentimentAnalysis function simulates a key backend microservice, where a dedicated Python environment (e.g., FastAPI running FinBERT) would perform the resource-intensive NLP task and return the resulting sentiment and score.

Persistence Layer: All user actions (saving/removing articles) interact directly with the Firestore database, ensuring security and persistence tied to the unique user ID.

Setup and Installation

This is a single-file React component, designed to run within a modern build environment.

Environment: Ensure you have Node.js and npm/yarn installed.

Dependencies: This project relies on standard React/Firebase packages: firebase/app, firebase/auth, firebase/firestore, and the visualization library recharts.

Local Setup: Integrate the FinancialNewsAggregator.jsx component into a React project structure where Tailwind CSS is configured.

Firebase Configuration: The application requires environment variables for Firebase configuration (__app_id, __firebase_config, __initial_auth_token) to connect to the Firestore instance.
